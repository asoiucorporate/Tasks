# The 'Happy Family' mini-project keeps striking!

The idea of the project is to describe the structure of a family while taking into account that every human has relatives and the family members can change over time.

Working with collection

The task:
Improve the project: replace all the arrays with collections

Techniqual requirements


Pet, Human, Family classes must include collections instead of arrays.

habits of the Pet class should be stored in the Set interface.

schedule of the Human class should be stored in the  Map interface.

children (list of children) of the Family class should be stored in the List interface.
A family can now have multiple pets - they should be stored in the Set interface.
Fix the unit-tests.
